We are proud to present to you our newest product, __SysKit Monitor__, which comes with a new name and logo! We’ve decided it was time for a change and that with moving to our new office space, we might do a bit more than just remodeling and address change. In the rebranding process, we went all in, by changing the company name, logo, and all the names of our products. 

Our company name has now changed from __Acceleratio__ to __SysKit__! To reflect this, we also changed our server monitoring tool __SysKit__ to __SysKit Monitor__.
You can read more about the story behind in the [Rebranding Announcement]().

This release brings a couple of improvements and bug fixes.
Now, go check out what SysKit Monitor has to offer by refreshing your favorite server monitoring tool. As always, feel free to contact us or send us any suggestions.
