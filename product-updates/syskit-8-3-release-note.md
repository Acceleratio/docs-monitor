We have shipped SysKit 2016 R2 – 8.3.0. This minor release brings new features and improvements.

Thanks to our hardworking SysKit team, you can now create PowerShell Alerts and have the results sent to your email. The team has also done a great deal of work in improving and optimizing the overall performance of the application! To dig out more details, read this release note.

SysKit’s PowerShell Script Wizard includes significant new features that extend its use, allowing you to effectively monitor critical and important jobs that run in your Windows-based environment. The major features are in the areas of defining alert conditions and options for PowerShell scripts.

Now, you can select the alert conditions based on the column types that the PowerShell script returns and specify when you want to be notified if the alert condition is met. SysKit will generate the .csv file, which contains all data matching the applied conditions and trigger an alert that allows you to control the administration of your environment and respond to issues more quickly.

SysKit comes with almost fifty new PowerShell scripts, twenty custom reports, and three monitoring templates that are ready for you to download and explore! Awesome, isn’t it?
