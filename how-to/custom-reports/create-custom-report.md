This article explains how to create a custom report that meets your needs better than the built-in reports.

Creating a new custom report is very simple everything is done throught the wizard. For example, this will be a report that shows users’ idle time on the servers for the current day.

### Step 1: Custom Report Name

Enter a unique name for the custom report.

### Step 2: Type of Data

You must select the type of data you wish to report on. Your report can show data about activities, applications and logon audit.

### Step 3: Select Fields

You can select fields to be included in your report.

### Step 4: Field Order and Sorting

Using arrows on the right side you can order the report fields the way you wish to view them and you can select default sorting for each field.

### Step 5: Set Filters

Here you can specify the conditions you want to check for each field. Each field contains different types of data (numbers, dates, …) so you can select specific conditions which depend on the data type. For example, for date fields you can select Today, Yesterday, Next Week and more, and for activity state you can select Active, Idle, Disconnected, Remote Control, Other.

### Step 6: Group By

You can select fields by which you wish to group the resulting data.

### Step 7: Aggregations

This step will be shown only if it is possible to calculate the summary for one of the selected fields (this is when one of the fields is a numeric type).

### Step 8: Chart

This step allows selecting the chart type, color pallete and whether to show legend and labels.

### Step 9: Chart Axes

This step allows defining chart axis properties.

### Step 10: Chart Data Binding

This step allows binding columns to series and arguments.

### Final Step

Custom report has been successfully created and just click Finish to close the wizard.
