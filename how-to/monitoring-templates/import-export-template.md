This dialog provides options for importing and configuring Monitoring Templates in the SYSmt format, as well as exporting functionality. Monitoring Templates are generated in this format when our development team creates them upon our customersâ€™ requests.

When importing previously created Monitoring Templates in the __SYSmt__ format, simply select the monitoring template definitions you want from your local or network drive. Afterward, __assign__ the template(s) to the desired __computers__ or __computer groups__ from the upper ribbon.  
When applying the template(s) to collect custom performance counters data for monitored computers, these two options are available:
__Assign to Computers__ and __Assign to Computer Groups__.

If one or more Monitoring Templates have been assigned to specific computers or computer groups, the associated performance data will be displayed on the [Detailed Analysis](#internal/get-to-know-syskit-monitor/reports/performance-reports/computer-performance.md) report.

> __Tip!__ When you are importing or exporting a monitoring template definition, all its monitoring elements will be imported / exported.
