### Download Custom Reports

This dialog enables you to download and import the __predefined Custom Reports__ from SysKit’s __repository__. There, you can find around __twenty__ custom reports created for various purposes and categorized by the data type they display. It is very important to read the report description on the right side.

If you select a report from the list, the following report information will be displayed:

+ __Name__ – the name of the report.
+ __Description__ – the description of the report. It is very important to read the description, as it may clarify the purpose of the report.
+ __Version__ – reports can be changed and updated with more advanced functionality by our product team.
+ __Author__ – the name of the author.
+ __Date Published__ – the date when the report was published.

Depending on which tab is selected, the available options change their purpose:

+ __Search box__ – Use this option to search through the available reports. The report description will also be included if it matches the entered criteria.
+ __Online tab__ – Displays reports that are ready for installation.
+ __Installed tab__ – Displays a list of reports that are already installed. If you want to remove installed reports, just select them and click the Remove button. Afterwards, the report(s) will be deleted.
+ __Updates tab__ – Displays a list of reports that have been updated by our product team. If you want to update installed reports, just select them and click the __Update__ button. Afterward, the report(s) will be replaced with new ones, but all the previously defined user settings will __not be kept__ for both normal and SQL types.

When downloading available custom reports, simply select the reports and click the __Install__ button. After the custom reports have been downloaded, the success dialog will appear, informing you that the reports have been installed. The reports will also appear in the left navigation within their corresponding folder structure.
