Gateway Reports provide an overview of all connections made via RD Gateways.

> __Info!__ Remote Desktop Gateway __(RD Gateway)__ is a role service that enables authorized remote users to connect to resources on an internal corporate or private network, from any Internet-connected device that can run the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client.

Currently available reports are:

+ __Current Connections__ – displays the current user connections to the computers made via RD Gateway.

  > __Please note!__ The Current Connections report is a real time report.

+ __Connection Log__ – displays a detailed connection log for a selected user – shows start, end and total times for the connections made via RD Gateway in a specific session state.  
+ __Connection Log Summary__ – displays users’ activities over the course of one day: first logon and last logoff time, total time connected via RD Gateway and time spent in different session states.  
+ __Client IP Addresses and Targets__ – shows the source IP address for each user that connected via RD Gateway. When combined with a computer filter, you can pinpoint the exact computer a user had connected to.

> __Please note!__ In order to see the Gateway Reports it is necessary to have at least one RD Gateway server added to monitoring.
