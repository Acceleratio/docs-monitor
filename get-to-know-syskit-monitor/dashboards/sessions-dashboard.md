__Sessions Dashboard__ is shown when you start the SysKit application and it enables you to see live data, such as the __current sessions__ and __running processes__ on all servers. There are five system dashboards which provide a quick overview of user activities, application usage, used licenses and overview of important reports.

+ __Dashboard navigation bar__ – Provides the list of System Dashboards and custom made dashboards. By navigating throughout them, you will get an easy overview of your computers, users and applications data.
+ __Sessions Dashboard chart__ – Provides live time graphical overview of sessions in progress.
+ __Sessions__ – Shows the number of sessions in progress. You can choose which session states you want to display on the Sessions Dashboard chart. Clicking on the __Show current sessions__ link provides more detailed report.
+ __Computers__ – List of active computers and their states. Different computer color marks indicate different computer state. By hovering over the help icon, see the computer color state legend. Clicking on the __Manage Computers__ link opens the __Administration – Computers__ category which provides more information about each computer individually.

There are __2 visual color indicators__ for computers’ sessions:

+ __Yellow__ – online computer that has reached an alarming number of users (e.g. 51 users online, the warning threshold is 50)
+ __Red__ – online computer that has reached a critical number of users (e.g. 101 users online, the warning threshold is 100)

Use the [Administration – Computers](#internal/) category to adjust the values for __warning__ and __critical__ session thresholds.

+ __Processes__ – Number of currently running processes. Clicking on the Show current processes link provides more detailed report.
+ __System Job status__ – This is an indicator of a system job status, located in the lower-left corner. Here you can:
  + view the system job progress state, computer name on which a system job is currently running and when the job was started,
  + view information about currently running system jobs,
  + open the System Jobs dialog.

It is not possible to edit nor save Session Dashboard as a dashboard template nor change the date range.
It is however possible to [do this with the other dashboards](#internal/).

Users can also [create custom dashboards](#internal/) that will better meet their needs.
